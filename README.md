## Hi there 👋

- ☀️ By day, I'm an Engineering Manager leading an amazing team of 8 engineers, building Intelligent Document Processing and solutions to empower agents with connectivity. Helping engineers, STEM students, and anyone interested in technology or software engineering unlock their full potential is one of the most rewarding parts of my work — and learning from my peers is one of the hidden gems that makes the journey even more meaningful.
- 🌙 In my own time, I'm building MCP-based scraping tools to support my research projects.
- 🌱 I'm currently diving into the MCP Server ecosystem.
- 🎮 When time permits, I enjoy playing games.
- 📖 Currently reading: *Die with Zero*.
- 💬 Always happy to chat about Kubernetes, Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP), or Microservices Architecture!
